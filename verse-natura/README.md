## Features

  * **Poem Search:** Search for poems by name using a dedicated search bar.
  * **External API Integration:** Fetches poem data from an external poetry API.
  * **Poem Creation:** Users can write and submit their own poems.
  * **Poem Display:** View a collection of user-created poems.
  * **Tabbed Interface:** Easily switch between the "Search Poems" and "Community Poems" sections.
  * **Responsive Design:** (Optional, but good to mention if implemented) The application is designed to be responsive across various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

  * **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  * **React Router:** For navigation within the application (e.g., switching between tabs).
  * **Axios (or Fetch API):** For making HTTP requests to external APIs.
  * **(Optional) State Management Library:** (e.g., Redux, Zustand, Context API) If used for more complex state management.
  * **CSS Modules / Styled Components / Tailwind CSS:** For styling the application.
  * **(Potentially) A Backend for Community Poems:** If user-created poems are persisted (e.g., Node.js with Express, Firebase, Supabase). This README assumes a simple local storage or a mock API if no backend is explicitly mentioned.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js (LTS version recommended)
  * npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL.git
    cd poem-finder-app
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Application

To start the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This will open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Integration

This application integrates with a third-party poetry API for searching poems.

  * **API Endpoint:** Replace `YOUR_POETRY_API_BASE_URL` with the actual base URL of the poetry API you are using.

  * **API Key:** If the API requires an API key, ensure it's securely managed (e.g., via environment variables).

    Example of fetching poems (conceptual):

    ```javascript
    // In a React component or utility file
    import axios from 'axios';

    const searchPoems = async (query) => {
      try {
        const response = await axios.get(`${YOUR_POETRY_API_BASE_URL}/poems/search?name=${query}`);
        return response.data;
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error searching poems:", error);
        return [];
      }
    };
    ```
