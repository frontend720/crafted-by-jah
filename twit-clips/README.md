# TwitClippy

### Your Personal Library for Twitter Videos

TwitClippy is a full-stack web application designed for Twitter users who want a dedicated space to browse, save, and manage their favorite video clips. Instead of a generic bookmark folder, TwitClippy provides a focused, media-centric experience, ensuring you never lose a great clip again.

## About The Project

Twitter is a fantastic source of timely video content, but its built-in bookmarking feature is a catch-all for tweets, articles, and images. I wanted to create a tool specifically for video enthusiastsâ€”a personal, searchable library of just the clips they love.

This application allows users to sign up for an account, search for any public Twitter user, and browse through their entire video history. With a single click, a user can save a video's URL to their private collection. The "Saves" page provides a custom video player experience to view and manage their curated library.

## Key Features

  * **User Authentication:** Secure user sign-up and login functionality to ensure every user has their own private collection.
  * **Search by Twitter Handle:** Dynamically fetches and displays a user's video media by querying the Twitter API.
  * **"Infinite Scroll":** A "Continue" button allows users to load more tweets and browse deeper into a user's media history.
  * **One-Click Saving:** Easily save any video from the search results to your personal collection.
  * **Personal Video Library:** A dedicated "Saves" page to view and manage all your saved video clips.
  * **Custom Video Player:** A clean, modern video player with playback speed controls and auto-play functionality.

## Built With

This project is a full-stack MERN application, leveraging modern tools on both the frontend and backend.

**Frontend:**

  * [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
  * [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) (for state management)
  * [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) (for API requests)
  * [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) (for card components)
  * [React Player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-player)
  * [Day.js](https://day.js.org/) (for relative timestamps)

**Backend:**

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
  * [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
  * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
  * [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
  * [JWT (JSON Web Tokens)](https://jwt.io/) (for authentication)
  * [Twitter API v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api)

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

Implementing secure user authentication and connecting it to a one-to-many data relationship (one user, many saved videos) was the most challenging and rewarding part of this project. It provided invaluable experience in full-stack development.

  * **Data Modeling:** The initial database design required careful planning to correctly link a `user` document to a `video collection` document. The final solution involved creating a separate collection for videos that references a `userId`, which is a robust and scalable pattern.

  * **State Management:** I learned the importance of having a reliable, centralized state management system. Using React's Context API, I created an `AuthContext` and an `AxiosContext` to handle user state and API functions. A key lesson was learning how to properly trigger UI updates after a database operation (like deleting a video) by creating a "trigger state" that forces a re-fetch of the data.

  * **Debugging Asynchronous Logic:** I encountered a persistent `404 Not Found` error when trying to update a user's collection. By using the browser's Network tab and strategic `console.log` statements, I traced the issue to a mismatch between the `_id` of a document and the `userId` being sent from the frontend. This taught me to never make assumptions about the data flow between client and server.

  * **Advanced Mongoose Queries:** This project forced me to move beyond simple CRUD operations. The crucial breakthrough in the update logic was understanding the subtle but powerful difference between Mongoose's `findByIdAndUpdate` (which only works on a document's `_id`) and `findOneAndUpdate` (which can query by any field, like `userId`). Implementing a successful `upsert` operation on the backend dramatically simplified the frontend logic.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js (v16 or later)
  * npm
  * MongoDB (local installation or a free Atlas account)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/frontend720/twitclippy.git
 
2.  Install backend NPM packages
    cd twitclippy/server

3.  Install frontend NPM packages
    npm install

4.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:

    MONGO_URI='your_mongodb_connection_string'
    JWT_SECRET='your_jwt_secret'
    TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN='your_twitter_api_bearer_token'
    VITE_ENDPOINT='http://localhost:5000/api/videos' # Or your server port

5.  Start the backend server from the `/server` directory
    nodemon index.js

6.  Start the frontend client from the `root` directory
    npm run dev


## Future Improvements

  * Allow users to create and manage multiple, named collections.
  * Add search and filter functionality to the "Saves" page.
  * Implement folder organization for saved clips.
  * Fetch and display video thumbnails in the search results.
