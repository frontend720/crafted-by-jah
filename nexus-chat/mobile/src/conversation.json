    "text": "Certainly! Three major factors were:\n\n1.  **Economic Troubles:** The empire was vast and expensive to maintain. They suffered from high inflation, heavy taxes, and a disruption of trade routes.\n\n2.  **Constant Invasions:** Barbarian tribes (like the Goths and Vandals) continuously attacked the empire's borders, which stretched the military thin and was very costly.\n\n3.  **Political Instability:** The process for choosing a new emperor was often chaotic, leading to civil wars and a rapid succession of weak or ineffective rulers. \n\nDoes that make sense?"

Here are some fundamental data types:\n\n* **Strings**: For text, like `\"Hello World\"`.\n* **Integers**: Whole numbers, like `10` or `-5`.\n* **Floats**: Numbers with decimals, like `3.14`.\n* **Booleans**: Represent `True` or `False`.\n\nHere’s how you can write a 'Hello, World!' program:\n```python\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\nJust one line! It's that simple."

    "text": "Great question! Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable. They are one of Python's *most versatile* data types.\n\n> Lists are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.\n\nHere's a quick example:\n1.  **Create a list:** `fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]`\n2.  **Access an item:** `first_fruit = fruits[0]` (This would get 'apple')\n3.  **Add an item:** `fruits.append(\"orange\")`\n\nIf you want to learn more, I'd recommend checking out the official Python documentation: [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)."
